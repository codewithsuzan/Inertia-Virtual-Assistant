# Inertia-Virtual-Assistant
AI Assistant for Windows

Overview
This project is a simple AI assistant developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs on Windows. It leverages voice recognition to open applications and perform web searches based on user commands.

Features
Voice Commands: Activate the AI assistant by voice commands to open applications (e.g., "Open Chrome").
Web Search: Perform web searches directly from the assistant (e.g., "Search for Python tutorials").
User Interface: Minimalistic and intuitive UI built with HTML and styled with CSS.
How It Works
The AI assistant uses the browser's built-in SpeechRecognition API for voice commands. JavaScript handles the logic to interpret commands and execute corresponding actions such as opening applications or launching web searches.

Getting Started
To run the AI assistant on your Windows machine:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/codewithsuzan/Inertia-Virtual-Assistant.git)
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

Allow microphone access when prompted.

Start giving voice commands!

Dependencies
No external dependencies are required beyond a modern web browser with support for the SpeechRecognition API.

Future Improvements
Multi-platform Support: Extend support beyond Windows to macOS and Linux.
Enhanced Functionality: Integrate more advanced commands and functionalities.
UI Enhancements: Improve the user interface for better accessibility and interaction.
